# weltwerk/splat — Gaussian Splat Lens + Editor

A from-scratch, in-browser **3D Gaussian-splat renderer and editor**, built as another **replaceable
Weltwerk projection**. In the project's terms a splat scene is a `GeometryAdapter` / lens — a
*representation*, never authority. You can edit the representation all you like; it does not define truth.
This is the same separator the whole project rests on: `observation ≠ authority`. The lenses so far are
text → wireframe → voxel → meshes → FPS city → **gaussian splats**.

## Run

```powershell
cd "weltwerk\splat"; python test_splat_format.py; python test_splat_dsl.py; python splat_dsl.py
```

`test_splat_format` → **8/8**, `test_splat_dsl` → **8/8**; `splat_dsl.py` writes `dsl_demo.splat`. Then open
`weltwerk_splat_editor.html` — it compiles the DSL on load. Edit the **Text → Splat** panel and press
**Compile** to author a scene from text; orbit/erase/crop to edit; **Export .splat** to save.

## Phase 14 — what's genuinely superior here (and what isn't)

We will not out-render PlayCanvas SuperSplat or a GPU EWA splatter on raw fidelity. What this has that **no
splat editor has** is on a different axis — and it's the project's whole point: **text is the authority, the
splat cloud is a deterministic, verifiable projection of it.**

- **Text → splat compiler (`splat_dsl.py`).** A small, line-oriented, LLM-authorable DSL (`torus`, `sphere`,
  `box`, `plane` with `pos/color/density/gscale/seed`) compiles to a splat cloud. Superior on **authorability**:
  an LLM can write/edit the *text*, not wrangle a point cloud — true text-to-graphics.
- **Precise guarantees (MEASURED, 8/8).** The compile is **deterministic** (same text ⇒ same splats ⇒ same
  **content hash** = a provenance handle), **invariants are enforced** (opacity ∈ [0,1], every scale axis > 0,
  finite positions, a hard count cap), and **errors are structured** `{line, kind, message}` so an LLM can
  iterate without a human. The on-disk `.splat` contract is byte-exact and separately tested.
- **Anisotropic rasterization.** The editor now projects each splat's 3D covariance (scale + rotation) to a 2D
  ellipse in the vertex shader (Jacobian + 2×2 eigen-decomposition) — splats render as oriented gaussians, not
  round points. This is the real fidelity step (e.g. the synthetic torus's gaussians lie flat, tangent to the
  surface).

So the honest claim: **superior on provenance, determinism, and text/LLM-authorability; competitive (not
leading) on raw visual fidelity.** `deterministic ≠ photoreal`; `content-hash ≠ scene-quality`.

`test_splat_format.py` → **8/8**; `splat_format.py` writes `synthetic.splat`. Then open
`weltwerk_splat_editor.html`. It loads a synthetic scene immediately (no assets needed). Drag a real
`.splat` (or basic `.ply`) onto the window to view/edit it; **Export .splat** to save your edits.

Controls: drag = orbit · wheel = zoom · shift+drag = pan · **Erase brush** (click/drag to delete splats) ·
**Crop box** (slider-positioned box → cut inside / keep inside / recolor / set opacity) · Synthetic / Load / Export.

## MEASURED (verified by `test_splat_format.py`, 8/8)

- A splat record is **exactly 32 bytes** with the documented layout (position@0, scale@12, colour@24, rot@28).
- Position and colour survive encode→decode **exactly**; rotation within the 1/128 quantization bound.
- Whole scenes **round-trip**; malformed (non-multiple-of-32) buffers are **rejected**; the synthetic scene
  is **deterministic**. The editor's JS mirrors this byte-for-byte, so a file written by one is read by the other.

## Phase 15 — the inversion, proven: splats are an interchangeable, non-authoritative lens

This is the architecturally distinctive part (the renderer itself is good engineering, not novel). Most splat
systems treat the cloud as the scene. Weltwerk inverts that:

```
world.wrk → CausalGraph → WorldSim (runtime AUTHORITY) → splat_adapter → Gaussian splats   (disposable)
```

`splat_adapter.world_to_splats(sim)` projects a `WorldSim` snapshot to gaussians (colour from
`controller()`, brightness from `powered()`; destroyed entities vanish, disabled ones dim). It is a **pure
read** — it never calls `apply_event`. `test_multilens.py` turns the claim into machine-checked evidence:

- **Multi-lens authority invariance (MEASURED).** One snapshot projected through `render_primitives` (voxel/
  FPS) + a topology lens + the splat lens leaves the authority hash **byte-identical**. The GeometryAdapter
  boundary does real work: the world's identity is independent of how it's viewed. (`multilens_authority_invariant`)
- **Causal → splat coupling (MEASURED).** `destroy(generator)` makes the generator's splats **vanish** and the
  downstream turret's splats **dim** — driven by the graph alone; nothing edits the splat file or the renderer.
  (`causal_coupling`)
- Lenses are pure reads, agree on the same entity set, and the projected cloud round-trips the `.splat`
  contract. (`lenses_are_pure_reads`, `same_world_many_lenses`, `splat_roundtrip`)

So the same deterministic world can be viewed as wireframe, voxels, meshes, an FPS city, or splats **without
changing replay, diffs, forks, or the authority** — and that is now a passing test, not a paragraph.

**Digital-twin boundary (honest).** This is the *authority → splats* half. The reverse —
`scan → splats → entity extraction → authority graph` — hides a genuine perception/segmentation research
problem (`perception ≠ authority`) and is **NOT** built or claimed here.

## IMPLEMENTED (the editor — exercised on open, not auto-tested)

- **From-scratch splat renderer:** instanced quads, each shaded as a 2D Gaussian (`exp(-r²)`), depth-sorted
  back-to-front with alpha blending and `depthWrite=false` — the splat look, written by hand in a
  `RawShaderMaterial`, no splat library.
- **Per-splat** colour, opacity, and size; a global size slider.
- **Editing:** erase brush (ray-distance delete), 3D crop box (cut-inside / keep-inside), recolor and set
  opacity inside the box.
- **Load** `.splat` (full) and `.ply` (binary, position + RGB or `f_dc` spherical-harmonic DC term,
  best-effort, auto-subsampled for the browser); **Export** `.splat` (mirrors the contract).
- Orbit/zoom/pan camera, FPS + splat-count HUD, drag-and-drop.

## VISION (not built; would extend, not replace)

- **Full 3D-covariance EWA splatting** (anisotropic projected ellipses from a real covariance, proper
  spherical-harmonic view-dependent colour) — here approximated with screen-facing isotropic-ish gaussian
  billboards. This is the honest gap between "looks like splats" and "is a reference splatter."
- A **capture/training pipeline** (SfM/COLMAP + optimisation) to *create* splats — out of scope; this tool
  views and edits existing scenes.
- GPU radix-sort for millions of splats (current sort is CPU, throttled, comfortable to ~10–120k).
- The **causal-lens** version (Phase 13b idea): map splat clusters to Weltwerk entities so destroying a node
  visibly degrades its splats — the strongest "the renderer is just a lens" demonstration. Deferred.

## NOT CLAIMED

- **Not** reference-quality 3D Gaussian splatting, not photoreal novel-view synthesis, not a trainer, not
  real-time millions of splats. A faithful, hand-written *approximation* of the splat representation and a
  usable editor over the **verified** `.splat` contract.
- The lens holds **no authority**. Editing splats changes a representation; in a full Weltwerk pipeline the
  causal `.wrk` graph remains the source of truth and the splats are one of its projections.
