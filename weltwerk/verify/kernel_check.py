kernel_check.py — a bounded explicit-state MODEL CHECKER over the causal kernel (WorldSim).

Provenance: the *idea* (systematically explore all reachable states and check invariants, returning a
shortest counterexample trace) is reimplemented clean-room from explicit-state model-checking literature
— the discipline NASA's Java Pathfinder embodies for Java. No JPF source is used; JPF checks Java
bytecode, this checks an authored causal world. See ../../docs/PROVENANCE.md.

WHY IT FITS WELTWERK (the novel use):
  • The kernel's reachable state-set under a bounded set of edits IS the **Actual**.
  • The combinatorial space of all action sequences up to the depth bound IS the **Potential**.
  • A reached state that violates an invariant is a **ghost**: the checker returns the *shortest* event
    path to it — a replayable witness, not a guess.
This turns "validity-not-outcome" testing into actual exhaustive verification of the world's transition
relation, while staying 100% original code (own copyright → dual-license-safe).

EPISTEMIC STATES (honest grading of the result):
  • CLOSED  — the frontier emptied before the depth bound: the explored set is the COMPLETE reachable
              set for this action alphabet ⇒ invariants are PROVEN over it. `state-space-closed = proof`.
  • BOUNDED — expansion was cut off by the depth bound: invariants hold on what was explored but the
              rest is UNDERDETERMINED. `depth-limited ≠ proof`.
  • VIOLATED — at least one invariant fails; a counterexample ghost trace is attached.

MODEL BOUNDARIES (Arbitrary-Boundary Law — stated, not hidden):
  • The action alphabet is a MODEL CHOICE. Default = {destroy, repair} over every non-faction entity
    (a finite kill/revive lattice). `damage(amount)` is excluded by default because unbounded amounts
    make the state space infinite; include_capture adds {capture→faction}. Different alphabet ⇒ different
    Potential. The checker proves nothing about edits outside its alphabet. `alphabet ≠ all-edits`.
  • State identity = (per-node alive/status/health) + explicit captures. It deliberately EXCLUDES the
    event log, so two different paths to the same world are ONE state (that is what makes closure finite).
    `path ≠ state`.
  • Invariants are predicates we chose; passing them is `consistent-with-our-invariants`, not `correct`.
    `holds-here ≠ true`.

NOT a substitute for: testing concrete gameplay, performance, or any property outside the alphabet.

PHASE A.2 STEP 3: the SEARCH ALGORITHM has moved to `engine.ExplicitStateBFSEngine`. This module is now
the compatibility API — `check()` (a shim that delegates to the engine), the `CheckResult` / `Violation`
result types, `replay_path`, the kernel state helpers (`_snapshot_state`/`_restore_state`/`_sig`/
`build_alphabet`), and `DEFAULT_INVARIANTS`. No search algorithm remains here. `compat-layer ≠ algorithm`.
